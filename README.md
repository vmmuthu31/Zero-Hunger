# Zero-Hunger_REACT

## Mobile app for nutrition education with playful approach

This is the prototype of an application made to teach users to eat healthily while having fun, using a gamification approach to incentivize them.
The idea behind it is to photograph the food you eat to feed the game mascot, represented by a small carrot.
This functionality is simulated by scanning a QR code, which replaces food recognition using A.I. algorithms.
It is possible to take on challenges (Goals) involving more intensive use of the application and recording different dishes during a longer period of time than the single meal.
By recording different meals and completing Goals, it is possible to gain experience, to level up and unlock new items to customize the mascot, and coins to be used to purchase items in the Shop.
With each recorded meal you receive Feedback on the plate a generic Tip that provides notions about healthy cooking, these tips are then accessible from the appropriate screen.
